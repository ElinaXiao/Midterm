                <h1>Classification of common sugars</h1>
                <h3>(According to the refining degree, source, shape and color of sugar, common sugars can be roughly divided into the following categories:)</h3>

                <h2>Coarse sugar:</h2>
                <p>It belongs to unrefined raw sugar with low purity, many impurities, large water content and light yellow color, such as domestic No. 2 sugar and imported Brazil sugar and Cuba sugar.</p>
                <h2>Brown sugar powder:</h2>
                <p>The purity is higher than that of brown sugar, and it's easy to weigh and use.</p>
                <h2>Glucose powder and glucose syrup:</h2>
                <p>Powdered glucose is obtained from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis or hydrolysis in the presence of acid. After spray drying, powdered glucose is obtained, with a general water content of 8%.</p>
                <h2>Malt block and maltose syrup:</h2>
                <p>Barley and wheat are produced by maltase acting on water. The finished product produced in China is generally called caramel.</p>
